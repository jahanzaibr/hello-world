# hello-world
My first repository, created while going through the guide.
I recently graduated as an Electrical Engineer but, due to my interest in programming and because I like the working environment of a programmer more than I like working on an industrial plant, I am now taking online courses to enhance my programming skills and improve my chance of securing a job.
My interest so far has been in Data Science, Machine Learning and now I am learning web-development.
